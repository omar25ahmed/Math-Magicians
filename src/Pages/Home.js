        The history of mathematics deals with the origin of discoveries
        in mathematics and the mathematical methods and
        notation of the past. Before the modern age and the worldwide
        spread of knowledge, written examples of new
        mathematical developments have come to light only in a few locales.
        From 3000 BC the Mesopotamian states of
        Sumer, Akkad and Assyria, followed closely by Ancient Egypt and
        the Levantine state of Ebla began using
        arithmetic, algebra
        and geometry for purposes of taxation, commerce, trade and also in the patterns in nature,
        the field of astronomy and to record time and formulate calendars.

        The earliest mathematical texts available are from Mesopotamia and
        Egypt Plimpton 322 (Babylonian c. 2000 â€“ 1900
        BC), [2] the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (Egyptian c. 1800 BC)[3] and
        the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus (Egyptian
        c. 1890 BC).
        All of these texts mention the so-called Pythagorean triples, so,
        by inference, the Pythagorean
        theorem seems
        to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and
        geometry.
